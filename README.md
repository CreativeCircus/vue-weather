# Vue Weather

## 1. Setup
This project is already set up with Circus Starter, a versy basic Vue app, and 2 axios/ajax requests to a weather API.

## 2. Homework
It's already getting the data you need, and storing it in the `current` and `forecast` Vue data variables.

Change your template to display that data. Look at the console to see how the data is structured. It's a bit confusing at first, especially the timestamps, but you'll get it. 

The data available should be the current weather in Atlanta, and the 5 day forecast in, in 3 hour increments. Display both in a nice, visually pleasing UI.

You might want to look into Moment.js (https://momentjs.com/) to handle converting those timestamps to nice human-readable times.
